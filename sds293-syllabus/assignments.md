# Course Structure 

To prepare students to tackle the course’s motivating questions - especially What habits of mind do we need to develop to become machine learning practitioners? -  there are a variety of assignments in this course. Each week will be a mix of reading about machine learning topics, discussing and debating concepts, deriving machine learning theory from existing knowledge, and constant reflection about our learning and professional development. All due dates are posted on the Detailed Course Schedule and are due on the stated dates AOE (anywhere on earth).

## Assignments

The work in this course can be broadly broken down into four types:

 - **Routine Course Work,** including 12 labs, daily readings, and daily engagement journal
 - **Problem Sets,** including 24 group problem sets and 11 individual starred problems
 - **Professional development,** including two reflective writing assignments and persistent engagement with the course
 - **Final Project** that teaches a recent machine learning paper to fellow Smithies (who are not in the course)

### Starred Problems

Each week, you will complete a starred problem. The goals of these problems are to 1) apply what we’ve discussed in class on your own and 2) reflect on your learning so far. To accomplish these goals, starred problems will all follow the same procedure:

1. Put away all course resources
2. Download that week’s starred problem off moodle
3. Write your solution to the problem and upload it into moodle
4. Once properly uploaded, the instructor solution will appear
5. Compare your solution to the instructor solution 
6. Complete a reflection worksheet about this problem and what you would like to review as a result of doing this problem

These problems are based on completion (ie. you get the credit or not) based on both your solution and the content of your reflection. This means that you can get the problem totally wrong and still get full credit if you take the time to honestly reflect on your progress. This assignment structure is based on an assignment structure from Smith’s Engineering Program. 


 

## Weekly flow for the course 

Each week, you will have 2 group problem sets, a lab and an individual problem set due each week. Due to the calendar, we will have a change up to the weekly schedule following the thanksgiving break

#### Weekly Schedule - 

This course follows a predictable rhythm. The weekly flow will operate as follows: 

| Day    | Course Preparation and/or Activity | Due Date |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Monday     | GPset in class | Lab from the previous week & Starred Problem |
| Wednesday     | GPset in class | Recommended: reflect in your engagement journal |
| Friday     | Lab in Class | GPsets from this week |

### Workload

According to federal standards, each four-credit course should equate to at least 180 hours of work over the semester. If you are taking 16 credits, that equates to 720 hours of work over the 15 weeks of the semester, from the first day of classes until the end of the final exam period. In the case of this course, you will spend nearly 12 hours each week on my class alone (including our three hours of class meetings per week).[^1]

[^1]: Each of our 50 minute meetings is "counted" as 60 minutes. Since we meet 3 times per week, our "in-class contact time" is counted as 3 hours. 

In considering the work for this course, I believe that the approximate 9 hours per week _outside_ of class will breakdown something along these lines:

- 4 hours of class prep (working on the readings, posting questions, etc)
- 1 hour per week of lab wrap up
- 1 hour per week of GPset wrap up
- 2 hours per week on preparing and completing the starred problem
- 1 hour of "flex time" used to supplement any of the above areas and/or go to student hours

Notice that there is an hour of flex time. This is to accommodate weeks were you might want to spend more time on an assignment or a reading. For example, you might spend extra time working on a group pset or coming to student hours to discuss a reading.  

If you find that the time you are spending on this class is a lot more than 9 hours per week _outside_ of class or a lot less, let's check in.
