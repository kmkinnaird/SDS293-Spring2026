# Academic Integrity

Nothing is held more dear to a researcher than their integrity. To researchers, the most precious commodity is our ideas. While some researchers build tangible items that can be protected by patents, many researchers’ products are ideas and theories, which are less likely to be protected under things like patents. Instead, it is academic integrity that governs our research communities, protecting our ideas from being stolen. The system of academic integrity relies on researchers trusting each other to be honest and to act with integrity. 

## Academic Integrity at Smith 

As you may be aware of, Smith is continuing to transition towards an Academic Integrity Statement. This comes out of Smith's tradition of an Honor Code. This tradition goes beyond inviting students to act with integrity, instead it welcomes students as equal participants of the learning community, imbuing students with the same level of trust that we extend to our collaborators and colleagues. 

The Smith College Academic Integrity Statement (as stated on the [Academic Integrity page](https://www.smith.edu/your-campus/offices-services/dean-college/academic-integrity-board)) says: 
> Smith College provides its students with a world-class liberal arts education. The purpose of this education is not only to provide students opportunities for intellectual growth and advancement, but also to prepare its graduates to make powerful contributions to the world. Upholding the integrity of a Smith education, then, is at once a responsibility to oneself and to the community.
>
>The Academic Integrity Board (AIB) defines academic integrity as the alignment of students’ behaviors in academic courses with Smith’s commitment to the honest pursuit of genuine learning. Smith students are responsible for upholding their own integrity by adhering to all course policies and properly acknowledging all sources used in preparing academic work. When assignments require students to submit work that is the product of their own intellectual labor, faculty expect that students have neither used unauthorized resources nor engaged in unauthorized collaboration with others. When courses require students to submit work that is the product of intellectual engagement with fellow students, students should follow all of the guidelines set out for collaboration. All submitted coursework of any kind must be the original work of the student(s). Faculty are expected to clearly communicate to students how honest engagement is defined in each course.

>According to Smith’s Statement of Purpose, “the world needs a place where knowledge is not the end, but merely the beginning of creating incalculable good. And we will always be that place.” Delivering on this promise demands that students and faculty hold each other to the highest standard of academic integrity.


This trust bestowed to students in this statement is the same trust that exists in and among researchers within a research community, the same trust that exists between me and my collaborators. Simply put, at Smith, under the Academic Integrity Statement, I trust that you will each act with integrity, citing sources when you celebrate others’ ideas and noting who you work with when collaborating. 

This trust manifests in how assignments are created, in how work is completed, and in how we resolve instances where the trust has been broken. I create assignments knowing that while there are resources online that can offer complete solutions, and I trust you to not seek out such complete resources. I trust thatif you do stumble on a solution guide, you will not use it. Under this Academic Integrity Statement, students are expected to keep careful notes about the resources that they consult and the people that they collaborate with. We get to assume that the work handed in by a student is the creation of that student. Lastly, when there are concerns regarding potential violations to Academic Integrity, the resolution is determined by AIB, which has established by the community and trusted to seek restoration of the whole community’s trust through education and action. 

I regard our Academic Integrity with deep and profound respect. Being an educator at Smith wit this Academic Integrity Statement means we--your faculty--begin from a place of trust without any underlying suspicion of our students. Simply put, we-instructors and students-work from the assumption that all are acting in good faith and with the utmost integrity. This is an assumption that cannot be made at a school without this tradition and it is why it is a privilege to be both an instructor and a student at Smith under this Academic Integrity Statement. 

## Academic Integrity Practicalities 

The work you submit should be your own and created by you, unless explicitly listed as a group assignment. With the exception of the starred problems, I do encourage you to ask for help from your peers or myself when you have questions; however, copying is never allowed. The line between copying and helping is subtle. Below are a few guidelines:

- Do not share nor give your work with other students; instead, offer to discuss the big ideas of the task at hand. 
- Do not look at someone else’s work (including online solutions); instead, ask if you could talk with them about your ideas and share where you are getting stuck.
- Acknowledge those you talk or work with at the top of **every** assignment, **including any generative AI tools**. I will not dock points for getting acknowledged help from others. If you generate a solution or an argument with someone, in addition to acknowledging that person, recreate the solution or argument on your own in your own words. 

If you think you may have crossed the line between helping and copying, please talk to me. Do not let me discover that the line was crossed. If a violation of Academic Integrity is suspected, the student will be informed and will be given the opportunity to meet with the instructor. After the meeting, the instructor will decide if further consideration by the AIB is merited, and if so, the suspected violation will be reported to the AIB by the instructor. 

If you are unsure about how Smith's Academic Integrity Statement applies to our course, please consult with me or a class dean. We are happy to discuss this with you.

### Creation vs. Curation

In my role as your instructor, I am **curating** resources for you that I feel are best for the teaching and learning of machine learning. In this process of curation, I will give credit to those whose materials I have used and I will only use materials as allowable by copyright and fair use. 

In this course, you will be asked to **create** solutions for group problem sets and for the final project. In these acts of creation, you are demonstrating you most current understanding of the concepts in our course. This course will give you lots of chances to demonstrate what you know and lots of flexibility. 

I am aware that there is a tension between the curation that I am modeling and the creation that is being asked of you. My goal is to provide the best resources to you, which requires reading and sorting through many sources (curation). Your goal is to learn as much machine learning as deeply as possible, which requires a lot of practice, trying out machine learning ideas, reflecting on your attempts, and trying again (creation).
