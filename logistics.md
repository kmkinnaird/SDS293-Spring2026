# Course Logistics

## Class Meeting Times

The course meets three times per week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in Bass 002 from 9:25am to 10:15am. In supporting our course community, students should make every effort to be at our course meetings on time.

### Attending Lecture

We are still in the midst of a global pandemic. In keeping with the 
[COVID-19 Information](https://www.smith.edu/covid-19) laid out in 
Smith's Culture of Care, if you are ill and/or have _any_ COVID symptoms, 
please do **not** come to _in-person_ class. 

For all SDS courses, there is no virtual attendance option. For more information, please see our [program's website](https://www.smith.edu/academics/statistics). 

You do not need to email me to ask permission to miss class in person. However, if you are not able to be in-person for 2 consecutive meetings, then we need to check in. 

:::{note}
If you are not able to be in class for any reason, please consider doing at least two of the following: 

 - Get notes from a fellow machine learning explorer
 - Attempt the in-class work as soon as you feel well enough to do so. But also _remember:_ 
   - You do **not** have to do all of the GPsets to get a high score for that section of the grade 
   - You do **not** have to do all of the Labs to get a high score for that section of the grade 
 - Post questions to slack
 - If there is a GPset, post to slack to see if there is a group you can join and/or another person who missed class. 

:::

Similarly, do not come to student hours nor appointments if you are ill and/or have _any_ COVID symptoms. Please use the virtual student hours zoom link to attend student hours virtually, and a zoom link can be provided for any in-person appointment. 

:::{warning}
Do **NOT** come to in-person class or student hours, if you are ill and/or have any COVID symptoms. 
:::

Failure to respect this policy will result in an email to both the class dean and your advisor. 

### Pivoting Class Meetings

If I am unwell and/or experiencing any symptoms of COVID, class will be held on zoom. If this happens, I will send a slack message on the #general channel using the @everyone mention. Using @everyone should send an email to your inbox. 

If the college pivorts to remote learning, the course should be able to remain largely remain unchanged. The structure of this course is similar to one that I used in Spring 2021 for _Modeling for Machine Learning._ That course was fully online, and students had positive comments on this format. This course was run in person in Fall 2022 with this format, and students continued to reflect positively on this course structure. 

### Student Comments and Advice

This is the third running of my version of SDS 293, and I wanted to share comments and advice from machine learning explorers who have taken the first two versions of the course. It is my hope that these comments and advice will prove helpful to you this semester: 

> Prioritize understanding the pencasts. If you want a deeper understanding of the concepts, do the readings, but don't try to understand every sentence.

> Don't get freaked out by the readings! It'll all make sense while you're completing the group problems sets and the labs

> This course is great if you are interested in applications of statistics, make sure to stay on top of assignments.

> Ask lots of questions! You are not the only confused one

> You will get through the linear algebra part, the payoff is worth it. I would also say that for the final project, all of the papers are confusing, just read it and talk to the professor about it and you will understand

> This class is an amazing introduction to machine learning methods for SDS students. You will be introduced to all of the main ideas and topics in machine learning so that you will feel prepared to learn more about them in the future as you will have been exposed to them and understand what the goal is. 

> It is important to do all the reading and watch all the pencast before going to class, because they help a lot to be able to complete the assignments

> This class will be difficult at first, but then the ideas really come together, and it's kind of fun. Understanding the linear algebra and probability behind machine learning techniques is extremely helpful and translates well into other math classes.

> Definitely take the class! The strategy I recommend for success is to be engaged and ask questions during class times when you work on the group problem sets.

> The topics are fun and I personally would really want to learn more. You shouldn't get hung up on complicated math stuff in the materials but appreciate the general idea of the concept. It would be really helpful to work in a group to help each other out. Be prepared every time before coming into the class as it's adopting a flipped classroom mode

>  The readings were helpful, the pencasts were very well done, and I really liked being able to rewatch them as many times as necessary. Class time was always used very effectively and the brief recap of content at the start was also really helpful. The problem sets were probably the most crucial to my understanding of the material, and I really liked not having to work on them individually. Feedback on assignments was very thoughtful and I liked having access to the instructor's solution so I could see what I could have done better even if I didn't lose any points. I used to think I didn't like flipped classrooms, but after this class I'm starting to think I might have just never been in a flipped classroom that was so well executed before.

> I really appreciated the flexibility systems. I also liked the flipped classroom thing and using class time to work on the group problem sets with classmates. Without those activities, I don't think I would really understand the topics because in the readings and videos, the concepts feel very abstract

>The pencasts were great! Diving headfirst into the readings could be daunting, so the recordings were nice intros/overviews for centering what was happening in the text. Also appreciated the reading questions in the schedule for the same reason. Also big fan of the starred problem –– helpful for evaluating my understanding in a low–stress way. Problem sets were also very effective for discussing ideas and putting them in practice

## Communication

In addition to our synchronous meetings, our class will make of electronic communication, including our class slack, email, and Moodle messages. These methods of communication represent differing levels of formality and collaboration:

- **Slack:** Our slack site is the **_primary form_** of course communication. It allows for us to share where we are stuck with a reading, idea, or assignment, and where we can add helpful hints, request study groups, or share interesting news articles. Slack is much less formal than email, and salutations and signatures are not required. If you need to ask your instructor a question, this is the best place to do it either over a public channel or through direct message. **Please make a daily practice of checking slack as the __primary__ form of communication for the course**
- **Email:** Email communication is more formal than slack. It should be used in the cases that 1) concern something personal including **accommodations forms,** 2) require attachments, or 3) involve a number of people (who should be copied on the email). We also will use email to confirm individual appointments. Emails to the instructor should include a salutation (ie. "Dear...") and a signature (ie. "Best/Cheers/Kindly..."). 
- **Slack Mentions:** When I need to communicate with the whole class on a time-sensitive manner, I will use the @everybody or @channel functionality in slack. Please check that your slack settings will notify you either via slack or email. If you are using the email notifications, please be sure that your email does not treat these messages as spam.
- **Slack Emojis:** At times, I will ask you to emoji a message to show that you have read the message. This is a quick way for you to signal that you read it. If there's something that you have a question about in a "please emoji" message, please use the threading function for that message or send me a direct message on slack. 

:::{note}
Please sign up for [our slack site](https://sds-293-01-202603.slack.com/), add a profile picture, and introduce yourself with your name and a fun-fact about yourself on the #intros channel. After signing up, please determine how and where you will get notifications from slack. 
:::

Please note that on a typical workday, I leave my office just after 4:30pm. This means that emails and slack messages sent after 4:00pm will likely be received on the next business day. Similarly e-communication sent on the weekend will likely not be received until Monday. 


## Course Resources 

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field. So, our course will gather together a number of readings and resources from different sources. The below list of course materials are the minimum that I believe that you need to be successful in the course. If you feel that there is something critical missing from this list, please let me know.  

 - Variety of book chapters noted on the detailed course schedule and available at the library   
 - Bound notebook for notes, ideas, and scratch work    
 - Highlighters in at least 2 colors   
 - Pens or pencils in at least 3 colors   
 - Course Texts:     
     - [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) by Deisenroth, Faisal, and Ong. Note that we are using the [PDF of the printed book](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf)    
     - [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/downloads/) by Bishop
     - [Model-Based Machine Learning (Early Access)](https://mbmlbook.com/index.html) by Winn with Bishop, Diethe, Guiver and Zaykov
 

:::{note}
All of our books are freely available on the web (due to arrangements that the authors have made with their publishers), and thus cost $0 for students to read them. If you are having issues accessing the books, please let me know. 
:::

There are also a wealth of machine learning resources online and at the Library. Please note that for anything denoted as an E-Book at the library, there are limits placed on how many people can view the source. Instead, you can download sections (or whole books) for a period of time directly from the library. 


## Instructor Information

The instructor for this course is Katherine Kinnaird and I use she/her pronouns. My office is room 108 Bass Hall. The **best way** to reach me is on **slack.** If you need to email me, my email is kkinnaird@smith.edu.  

### Student hours

My student hours are time blocked in my calendar for you! Please drop by either in person or virtually. During the first class, we will vote when my two scheduled office hours will be. 

:::{note}
Student hours will be: 

 - Mondays from 10:30am to Noon
 - Fridays from 3:00pm to 4:00pm
 - By [appointment](https://bit.ly/Kinnaird-Appts)
:::

Below is an incomplete list of great reasons to go to student hours or to make an appointment:    
 - You haven’t had the chance to chat with me yet   
 - You want to see what my office looks like 
 - You have a question on a reading, assignment, or activity    
 - You want to share about the course, your time at Smith, or about yourself   
 - You read something about machine learning, computer science, statistics, or math that you have questions about   
 - You are thinking about what you want to do after Smith

#### Weekly Tea

In addition to student hours, I will also be hosting a weekly tea on Wednesdays from 3pm to 4pm. This is **not** the same as 
student hours, but rather a time to gather and enjoy a cup of tea. Please invite your friends! 

### Appointments

You are welcome and encouraged to make individual appointments with me. To make an appointment, please check my [appointment calendar](https://bit.ly/Kinnaird-Appts) for appointment slots that are set aside each week.
