# Welcome to SDS 293

I am so excited that you'll be joining this educational journey through 
the theoretical aspects of machine learning! You are now, just by being here, a machine learning explorer and practitioner. This course will 
help us frame out exactly what that means and also what _machine learning_ is.

## Official Course Description

In the era of “big data,” statistical models are becoming increasingly sophisticated. This course begins with linear regression models and introduces students to a variety of techniques for learning from data, as well as principled methods for assessing and comparing models. Topics include bias-variance trade-off, resampling and cross-validation, linear model selection and regularization, classification and regression trees, bagging, boosting, random forests, support vector machines, generalized additive models, principal component analysis, unsupervised learning and k-means clustering. Emphasis is placed on statistical computing in a high-level language (e.g. R or Python).

### Motivating Questions

There are a few questions motivating our course work: 
- What is Machine Learning?   
- What roles do statistics and linear algebra play in machine learning? 
- What habits of mind do we need to develop to become machine learning practitioners? 


### Course Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to...
1. Detail differences between supervised and unsupervised learning tasks and methods, as well as discuss the issues when dealing with large scale data
2. Compare machine learning models, and assess the efficacy of these techniques the context of task at hand and the assumptions underlying the models
3. Develop an appreciation for ethical implications of machine learning algorithms
4. Work collaboratively and reflectively to articulate details of machine learning techniques 


## Course Philosophy

This course is designed to be a first course in Machine Learning, but one that also prepares students to read and evaluate current developments in machine learning. The ultimate goal of this course is that students can read machine learning papers from the top conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc) and situate these papers among the big ideas of machine learning. The goal is not to understand every detail, but rather to review the introduction, motivation, and background for the proposed methods and be able to describe the high-level contributions of the proposed methods. Completing such a task is not as prescriptive nor as straightforward as completing a standard college course. There are turns and twists, failures and incremental progress, moments of confusion and bursts of clarity. This course seeks to begin your training in machine learning. Success in this course will be measured iteratively, placing emphasis on student’s ownership of the learning process and a student’s consistency of effort. 


### Stretch Zone

Borrowing language from the 2019 Google J-term course, when learning in a 
classroom setting, at any moment, we exist in one of three zones: safe, 
stretch, or strain. A student in the safe zone is completely comfortable, and 
the course material is completely within what the student already knows. The 
strain zone is the complete opposite of the safe zone. A student in the strain 
zone feels completely overwhelmed with the material to the point where they 
can’t find any meaningful connections between the current material and what 
the student already knows. 

The material in this course is intellectually challenging. Several of the 
topics are ones that took me a long time to fully understand their subtleties. The goal for this course is to spend the vast majority of our time in the stretch zone. In this 
zone, the material is just beyond our current knowledge base and while we are 
a bit uncomfortable with the material, we can see possible paths to tie the 
new material into our existing knowledge. In other words, in this class, our 
brains should be stretching, but not straining. 

At the end of each week, if you have not been surprised or challenged, or if 
you have no questions about the material, this could mean that you are in the 
safe or strain zones. If you find yourself exasperated or negative about the 
class, you may be in the strain zone. If you find yourself using words like 
“boring” or “easy”, you are likely in the safe zone. If you are in either 
zone, please get in touch with me: in class, on slack, in an appointment, or 
send me an email. I want you to get the most out of this course, but I cannot 
make adjustments to the course if I do not have firsthand knowledge of what is 
going on.


## Syllabus 

This webpage and the associated links together function as the syllabus. 
Everything that you need to know about the course is either here or linked from here. 

The course syllabus is the most important document underlying the culture of 
our course and our classroom. I view my syllabus as a sacred document that 
both introduces and governs the course. In taking this view, I work to detail 
as much about the course as possible from the big picture ideas to the minute 
details of course policies. I believe that the first activity a student should 
do when beginning a course is to carefully read and examine the syllabus. In 
keeping with that belief, there are a few tasks in this document that will 
help us build our course community.

Please read the syllabus this week and complete these tasks to help shape our community. If you have questions about the syllabus, please ask them on our [class's first week's sli.do](https://app.sli.do/event/vUruyYfXruFLuuv8dpyAnM)
