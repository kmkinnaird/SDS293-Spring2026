# Assessment

Just like beginning a project, we begin this course with nothing completed yet; similarly, we begin the semester with no points, just yet. As assignments are assigned and returned we will slowly build points towards the 1000 possible points. In keeping with this philosophy, each assignment adds to your total score. In more traditional courses, one might begin with 100% and have their grade slowly chipped down to a final score. Instead in this course, we are building our grades up in concert with our knowledge about machine learning. View each assignment as a reflection of the depth of your machine learning knowledge base. 

## Grading Practicalities

This class uses points as the method for evaluation. There are more than 1000 possible points in the course with small "cushions" built in along the way. The 1000 points that you are working to accumulate for your final grade are distributed as follows:  

1. **Group Problem Sets:** 522 total points - 
   - 24 group problem sets, each with 18 possible points, for a max total of 342
   - 12 individual starred problems, each with 18 possible points,for a max total of 180
2. **Routine Course Work:** 306 total points - 
   - 12 Lab assignments, each with 9 possible points, for a max total of 90
   - Daily engagement journal for a total of 216 points
3. **Final Project:** 100 total points with an optional checkpoint
4. **Professional development:** 72 total points - 
   - Two Reflective Writing assignments, each with 12 possible points 
   - Class engagement in person and on slack, for a total of 48 possible points



### Types of grading

There will be three kinds of grading for this course: 1) rubrics, 2) on completion, and 3) with student input. 

1. The following assignments will fall under typical rubric grading: group problem sets, your engagement journal, and the final project. Depending on the assignment, detailed rubrics may be issued before the assignment is submitted, while in other cases only general outlines will be given in advance of the assignment. 
2. The following assignments will be graded on completion: the labs, the individual starred problems, and reflective writing assignments. Note that completion here means that the work was completed in good faith. The act of turning in something does not guarantee a score of completion. But any work that is clearly done in good faith will be marked as complete and will earn full marks.
3. The class engagement part of the course will be graded with student input. In the sixth week of the course and during the last week of classes, you will be asked to complete a self-evaluation of your class engagement in context of the class engagement list. Your self-evaluations will be a critical part of determining this section of your grade, but not the only determining factor. 


#### Translating to the "real world"

This course iterates on each concept, pushing your knowledge to grow with each activity. This kind of iterative work is critical for learning new things and developing facility with them. The assignments scaffold as follows: 

 - **Reading and Prep work for class** - This is your first contact with the material. Just like meeting a person for the first time, you should pay attention to the big picture pieces, but not fuss over learning each detail perfectly. Instead, note questions in your engagement journal that you want to ask the next time you come into contact with the material.
 - **In class meetings and Labs** - The course is designed to be largely hands on. Each class meeting will be mostly working on something: problem sets and/or labs. Problem sets are largely “pen and paper” while labs are in Rmarkdown. Both are intended to be playgrounds for learning the material; so take tons of notes, make mistakes, and try again! This is our second contact with the material, and just like meeting a person for the second time, you should have follow-up questions about the material
 - **Individual Work** - Once we’ve read about the material and worked on highly structured activities, it is time to practice deploying concepts on your own from end to end. Our course has a weekly starred problem that is one step beyond the class activities in difficulty, and has a reflective learning component built in. 
 - **Final Projects** - After three different interactions with each concept, it is time to see where these concepts occur in the wild. The ultimate goal of the course is that you can read, situate, and discuss current papers in machine learning. In your final projects, you will create a small lesson to teach a recent paper to your fellow machine learning explorers. The primary goal of this project is to take the concepts from class and do something that stretches your knowledge. 

Similarly, I have built the grading structure for this course to be more similar to how I experience the “real world” that is with systems built in to allow for life to happen. These systems come in a few forms:

 - For the labs, group problem sets, and individual starred problems, the number of possible points is more than the maximum that I will use in my final computation. For example, there are 414 possible points for group problem sets, but yet, I will do my computation out of 342 points. This means that you can decide to not hand in 4 group problem sets for any reason. It could be because you are ill, you forgot about it, or you had too much work for your other courses. Note that pre-planned “dropping” of assignments should be used sparingly because we can not predict when life will happen (ie. illness, etc). 
 - For the final project, there is a checkpoint assignment that is completely optional, but if you complete it, you will be guaranteed at least 80 (of 100 possible) points. Missing the checkpoint is not a big deal, but can offer security to those with challenging finals periods. Additionally, the engagement journal will have prompts to help you brainstorm towards your final project. 

These systems attempt to match my experience of being in the “real world.” Assignments under the first system (ie. labs, group problem sets, and individual starred problems), you need to do about 80% of them well to get full credit for 100% in that portion of the grade. This matches my daily life where I can physically get to about 80% of my to-do list. Under the second system, it is often easier to edit a draft than to start from a blank page, and having small deadlines (where the reward is quick feedback) gives structure to larger projects. 


While I do believe that each assignment for this course is important, I also believe that the college structure does not always allow you to practice “real world” decisions such as balancing your health with your work. So while I will not tell you to hand in an assignment or to not hand one in, I would love to listen to you practicing making these decisions. 


### Due Dates

Each week, there are three deadlines: 

1. Labs
2. Starred Problems 
3. Group Psets

All work is **due at 9am** on the date listed on the [Detailed Course Schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TZUqJ4B2UpMo-x9xRmjFAw6R7p1Rt3ilLCrDMzPCNoY/edit?tab=t.0). This is a great moment to note these dates your system for keeping track of your work (ie. planner, calendar, etc). (If you want to really stretch here, do this for all assignments in all your courses.) 


#### Flexibility

In general, work should not be late. Later course content builds on previous content, and if one is spending time on an assignment that is passed due, then there is less time for the next assignment. Additionally the grading for this course has a number of flexibility systems in place, and I encourage that you take advantage of them as needed. 

This all being said, there’s a pandemic, and life is not normal. If you find yourself in need of a bit more time, send me a brief slack message at least a day before the work is due. In your message include 1) what flexibility systems you’ve already used, 2) why it is important to your learning that you get an extension, 3) propose a new due date for yourself, and 4) why the proposed extension will not hinder your ability to get the next assignment done on time. Your message should be no more than seven sentences long. 


## Letter grades: 

Traditional letter grades will be assigned using the below listed minimum points:

| Letter Grade    | Number of points |
| :----:       |    :----:   |
| A     | 950 - 1000 pts |
| A-    | 900 - 949 pts  |
| B     | 800 - 899 pts  |
| C     | 700 - 799 pts  |
| D     | 600 - 699 pts  |


At the instructor’s discretion, these grade cutoffs may be lowered at the end of the semester, but they will never be raised. Cut-offs not stated here for the pluses and minuses will be determined at the end of the semester.
